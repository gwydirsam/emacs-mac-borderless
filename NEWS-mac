* emacs-24.4.90-mac-5.4 (2015-02-18)
Based on 24.4.90.

Blend-and-blur of background color on OS X 10.10 is enabled again
because the mode-line erasure issue (Bug#19721) is fixed upstream.
The function `do-applescript' is now an alias of `mac-do-applescript',
which is implemented on top of `mac-osa-script'.


* emacs-24.4-mac-5.3 (2015-01-29)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-01/msg01040.html

Blend-and-blur of background color on OS X 10.10 is temporarily
disabled to avoid mode-line erasure on frame focus switch.  For some
reason, mode-line row's `enabled_p' flag in the current matrix is
sometimes reset even if it is visible.  This causes blank mode-line on
"expose" (drawRect:) events.  In principle, this mode-line erasure can
also happen on older versions of OS X or this version of Emacs Mac
port.  But it is usually observed on OS X 10.10 together with previous
5.x versions of Emacs Mac port, because the use of NSVisualEffectView,
which provides the blend-and-blur feature, triggers full frame
"exposure" on focus switch.

** Fixed bugs

*** Special-display completion frame becomes transparent.
Reported by Alan Shumitt.
Adapt a fix for Bug#16619.

*** `mac-auto-ascii-mode' on TTY terminals disables prefix keys with
the meta key.

*** Control-F2 is passed to the system even if
mac-pass-control-to-system is set to nil.

*** Synthetic bold text looks thinner on Retina display/HiDPI mode.
This is because stroke line width for text drawing is not correctly
scaled (whereas it is correctly scaled when drawn to bitmaps) on such
environments.  I've been reporting this to Apple on every OS X update
since it was 10.7.4, but I couldn't get any response until recently.
At last Apple answers that there are no plans to address this issue
(rdar://11644870) currently.  So I added a workaround that would cause
a bad reverse effect if the original issue were fixed.

*** `mac-ae-set-reply-parameter', which is used for reporting an error
in Apple event hander, has not been working since emacs-24.2-mac-3.2.

*** Input source functions ignore disabled input source ID strings.

** Improvements

*** URL handler via Apple events now accepts the `org-protocol' scheme
as well as `mailto'.


* emacs-24.4-mac-5.2 (2014-11-21)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2014-11/msg01719.html

** Fixed bugs

*** The function `mac-osa-script' does not process ARGS (6th and later
arguments) correctly.

** Improvements

*** Even if the current keyboard layout maps some key with the control
modifier to insertion of a character, which would be recognized as an
ordinary insertion in applications that use the standard Cocoa text
view, it is interpreted as a combination with the control modifier.
This behavior is consistent with the Mac port version 4.x and earlier,
and also obviates the previous fix for "C-_" on JIS keyboard.

*** If /usr/include does not exist, then the Xcode SDK dir is examined
as a candidate of libxml2 header location if it does not contain any
special characters or blanks.

*** The function `mac-osa-script' now accepts compiled code, which can
be generated by a new function `mac-osa-compile', and a file name as
well as a script source.
Note: As of OS X 10.10.1, specifying compiled code generated from a
JavaScript source causes crash.  I think this is a bug in OSAKit.

*** New function `mac-do-applescript', which is implemented on top of
`mac-osa-script' and intended as a future replacement of
`do-applescript'.

*** New functions and hooks for interaction with the Text Input Source
Services on Mac OS X 10.5 and later: `mac-input-source',
`mac-input-source-list', `mac-select-input-source',
`mac-deselect-input-source',
`mac-selected-keyboard-input-source-change-hook', and
`mac-enabled-keyboard-input-sources-change-hook'.

*** New global minor mode `mac-auto-ascii-mode' for Mac OS X 10.5 and
later.  If enabled, it automatically selects the most-recently-used
ASCII-capable keyboard input source on some occasions: after prefix
key (bound in the global keymap) press such as C-x and M-g, and at the
start of minibuffer input.
Note: Strictly speaking, its implementation has a timing issue: the
Lisp event queue may already have some input events that have been
processed by some previous keyboard input source but yet to be
processed by the Lisp interpreter.

** Fixed bugs

*** "C-_" on JIS keyboard is recognized as "_".
Reported by OHKAWA Yuichi.

*** Checking "Reduce translucency" in the Accessibility pane in the
System Preferences on OS X 10.10 makes fringe areas translucent.
Reported by Nicholas Riley.

** Improvements

*** Blend-and-blur of fringe background on OS X 10.10 is no longer
hard-coded.  It can be customized per face by specifying a special
name `alpha:ALPHA' as a value of the background stipple attribute.
For example,
  (set-face-stipple 'fringe "alpha:50%")
or
  defaults write org.gnu.Emacs Emacs.fringe.attributeStipple alpha:.5
will (mostly) recover the appearance of the previous release.
Note: Setting stipple for the default face may not work as you expect.
This is the same limitation as the standard stipple feature on X11.
Also, blend-and-blur is temporarily turned off during animations.

*** New experimental functions `mac-osa-language-list' and
`mac-osa-script'.  The latter is like `do-applescript', but can
execute JavaScript as well as AppleScript on OS X 10.10.

*** M-x toggle-frame-fullscreen RET -> M-x tool-bar-mode RET -> M-x
toggle-frame-fullscreen RET does not preserve tool bar visibility on

** Fixed bugs

*** Crash when closing a fullscreen frame on OS X 10.10 Beta.

*** Full screen transition animation is broken on OS X 10.10 Beta.

*** Title bar buttons are misplaced if we toggle the tool bar on
a fullscreen frame on OS X 10.10 Beta.
I think this is a bug in AppKit.  A workaround is added.

** Improvements

*** Blend and blur fringe background of the focused frame with the
contents behind it on OS X 10.10 Beta.
This is currently experimental, hard-coded, and subject to change.

** Fixed bugs

*** Wrong return value of display-monitor-attributes-list.
Reported by Leo.

*** If you point to the left "%", which has both left and right
overhangs for Monaco 12pt, of "%%" in the mode line, then the right
one is also drawn with upper and lower box.

** Improvements

*** New variables mac-right-control-modifier,
mac-right-command-modifier, and mac-right-option-modifier.
Note: the left and right versions cannot be distinguished on some
environments such as Screen Sharing.  Also, certain combinations of a
key with both versions of the same modifier do not emit events at the
system level.

*** A single physical modifier key can be mapped to different Emacs
modifiers depending on its input type (ordinary keys, function keys,
or mouse operations) using the property list format `(:ordinary SYMBOL
:function SYMBOL :mouse SYMBOL)'.  By default, the option key works as
the normal Mac option key for the ordinary keys, and as the Alt
modifier for the function keys and the mouse operations.


* emacs-24.3.90-mac-4.90 [experimental/hackers-only] (2014-04-14)
Based on Emacs 24.3.90.
High-resolution icons are now distributed as a separate package.
File notification is supported via GLib (you'll also need `pkg-config'
when running the configure command).
The `image-io' image type supports `:max-width', `:max-height', and
`:format' keywords just as in `imagemagick'.
Now that Image mode supports multi-frame image navigation (`f', 'b',
and `F'), you can browse multi-page documents in several formats that
`image-io' supports (e.g., PDF and DOC) with the setting like this:
  (when (and (image-type-available-p 'image-io)
	     (not (boundp 'imagemagick-render-type)))
     ;; Image I/O is used as a fallback of ImageMagick.
     (setq imagemagick-enabled-types t)
     (setq imagemagick-types-inhibit
	  (cons 'XML (delq 'PDF imagemagick-types-inhibit)))
     (imagemagick-register-types))
Note: if you have ImageMagick installed, you need to build the Mac
port executable without the genuine ImageMagick support so `image-io'
can be used as a fallback of `imagemagick'.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2014-04/msg00176.html

** Improvements

*** Graphical drawing operations might be performed in non-main
threads via GCD (Grand Central Dispatch) on Mac OS X 10.6 and later.
You can turn this off by setting `mac-drawing-use-gcd' to nil.

*** DocView mode generates pixel-doubled "@2x" bitmap image files in
addition to normal ones on high-resolution environments such as Retina
display or HiDPI mode.

animation effects on OS X 10.9.

*** M-x menu-bar-open RET always activates the menu bar in the primary
monitor on OS X 10.9 where a non-primary monitor can also have a menu

*** Document rasterization (including PDF) in the image type
`image-io' now caches the loaded documents for a while so as to avoid
loading a multi-page document several times when successively
rasterizing multiple pages of the document.

*** Respect the "Swipe between pages" setting for touch-sensitive
mice/trackpads.

*** Fonts used in the "CJK variety" line in the etc/HELLO file are

indentation and end of line.

*** Text scaling by gestures now tries to keep the vertical position
of the text under the pointer.

*** Support automatic selection of high resolution versions of images.
All supported image types respect the "@2x" file name convention.  SVG
images (via WebKit or librsvg) are rendered according to the backing
scale factor.  An appropriate image is selected from a multiimage TIFF
containing both 1x and 2x images if the image spec does not contain an
explicit `:index' property.

** Fixed bugs

*** HiDPI mode gives a blurry magnified text look on Mac OS X 10.7.3.

*** HiDPI mode shows wrong animation on transition from/to full screen.

*** M-x electric-pair-mode RET gives the warning "Note, built-in
variable `imagemagick-render-type' not bound".
Reported by Leo.

*** Tooltip place adjustment does not take account of multiple
monitors.
Reported by Pavel Martynenko.

*** Drag-and-drop highlight is not displayed just after exiting from
full screen.

*** Momentum scroll events after horizontal flicking interfere with a
multi-key sequence.

*** "Emacs" (in the menu bar) -> "About Emacs" then typing "q" causes
an error.

** Improvements

*** Support right-to-left text shaping.

*** New variable `mac-system-move-file-to-trash-use-finder', which
enables us to use the Finder for trashing so we can `Put Back' the
trashed items from the context menu.

*** Buffer switching by horizontal swiping/flicking and exiting from
the splash screen are accompanied with an experimental simple
animation effect on Mac OS X 10.5 and later.


* emacs-24.0.94-mac-2.90 [experimental/hackers-only] (2012-03-03)
Based on Emacs 24.0.94.  Drop support for Mac OS X 10.2 and 10.3.
Be aware of the (platform-independent) change in selection:
mouse-dragging no longer automatically copies the selected text to the
clipboard without M-w or `Copy' in the menu bar or the tool bar,
unless you set `mouse-drag-copy-region' to t.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2012-03/msg00030.html

** Fixed bugs

*** If compiled with ARC, "Emacs" (in the menu bar) -> "About Emacs"
leads to crash.

*** Emacs -q --eval "(set-frame-parameter nil 'fullscreen 'fullboth)"
does not hide the menu bar.
Reported by Leo.

** Improvements

*** New image type `image-io', which is parallel to `imagemagick' but
uses the Image I/O framework.  If not configured to link with the
ImageMagick library, then `image-io' provides a fallback
implementation of the `imagemagick' image type.

*** The variable `tool-bar-style' works like in GTK+.  The values
`both-horiz', `text-image-horiz' are synonymous with `both'.

*** Flicking either a touch-sensitive mouse with one finger or a
trackpad with two fingers horizontally issues a swipe-left/swipe-right
event, which is now bound to a simple buffer switching by default.

Adapt a fix for Bug#10500.

** Improvements

*** If Emacs.app is launched from Finder or via Resume, and there is
no ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist file, then it inherits environment
variable settings of user's login shell.  Note that if Emacs.app is
launched via the `open' command on Mac OS X 10.4 and later, then it
inherits environment variable settings of the shell where the command
is invoked, and this behavior is unchanged.

** Fixed bugs

*** The cursor is sometimes unerased.  This bug is not
platform-specific, but happens more frequently on Mac OS X 10.7.
Apply a fix for Bug#9415.

*** Crash when a separator is displayed in the tool bar on Mac OS X
10.7.

*** Can't toggle tool bar visibility for maximized frames on Mac OS X
10.7.

*** While executing AppleScript, pressing the down arrow key is
misinterpreted as `C-_' (usually bound to the undo command).
Reported by Leo.

*** Memory leak by y-or-n-p-with-timeout with GUI (Bug#9830).

** Improvements

*** Can compile with ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) on Xcode 4.2.
Specify CC="clang -fobjc-arc" on configure.

*** When running Ediff on a fullboth frame, it no longer gets obscured
by the menu bar or the Dock even if we focus Ediff Control Panel.

*** Unlike fullboth frames, fullscreen frames no longer occupy the
whole desktop area on Mac OS X 10.7 when the desktop width/height is
not a multiple of the nominal character width/height, respectively.

** Fixed bugs

*** Devanagari string U+0936 U+094D U+0930 U+093F (3 consonants
followed by 1 vowel, but the glyph corresponding to the last vowel
should be displayed first) is displayed wrong and may cause hang.
Reported by Tsuyoshi YASUMA.

*** Executables compiled on Mac OS X 10.6 with
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.5 do not run on Mac OS X 10.5.  This is a
regression introduced in 1.9994.
Note: executables compiled on Mac OS X 10.7 with
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 and some optimization flag still do not
run on Mac OS X 10.6, but I think this is a bug about weak linking in
the compiler or linker in Xcode 4.1 and already reported to Apple.

*** Updating display while a frame is resized from the bottom-right
corner does not work via Screen Sharing.  This is a regression
introduced in 1.9993.

*** Updating display while a frame is resized does not work from
non-bottom-right corners or edges on Mac OS X 10.7.

*** Some CPU consumption is observed even if executed with -Q -D (no
timer for cursor blinking) and M-x tool-bar-mode RET on Mac OS X 10.7.

** Fixed bugs

*** SVG display by WebKit is disabled on 64-bit executables.

*** The "Special Characters ..." item in the "Edit" menu doesn't
appear in non-English locales.

*** LastResort font is not shown on Mac OS X 10.7.

*** Pointer shape around the edges/corners becomes the pointing arrow
rather than the resizing arrows on Mac OS X 10.7 when mouse moved.

** Improvements

*** Support for the full screen mode introduced in Mac OS X 10.7.
Now `fullscreen' and `fullboth' values for the `fullscreen' frame
parameter have different meanings on Mac OS X 10.7: the former means a
new system-wide full screen mode with a dedicated desktop (or Space),
and the latter means the existing fullscreen feature.

Known issues: the menu bar does not appear with Control-F2 or
Command-Shift-/, and the tool bar is shown when mouse is moved to the
top even when tool-bar-mode is turned off.  I think these are bugs
(already reported to Apple), and I'd like to see if the situation
is changed with some future OS updates rather than tweaking with some
workarounds.

*** On Mac OS X 10.7, double-tapping either a touch-sensitive mouse
with one finger or a trackpad with two fingers changes the buffer text
scaling to unscaled if previously scaled.  And if previously unscaled,
then the buffer text is scaled so the default font occupies at least
`mac-text-scale-standard-width' columns in the tapped window.

*** Static compositions sometimes get truncated.
(See also http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/trac/ticket/409)

** Improvements

*** Color bitmap fonts such as Apple Color Emoji can be displayed if
compiled and run on Mac OS X 10.7.

*** Drag-and-drop highlights the frame under the pointer.

*** Option key temporarily inverts the "Jump to the spot that's
clicked" setting for scroll bars as in other applications.

*** Option key temporarily changes the behavior of line-up/down scroll
bar buttons to page-up/down as in other applications.

*** Holding shift key on startup is recognized as -Q option.

** Notes

*** This release is meant to make minimal adjustment for Mac OS X
10.7.  Don't expect integration with new features of Lion except the
color emoji display support mentioned above.

*** SVG support by WebKit is disabled on 64-bit executables for now,
because it may hang while initializing plugins in some cases.  If you
do need SVG display, then build as a 32-bit executable or use librsvg.

** Fixed bugs

*** Text scaling by pinch out/in and by C-x C-+/C-- are not in sync.

*** Shift-Tab is recognized as Tab, and keyboard navigation after
Command-Shift-/ doesn't work on Mac OS X 10.6.  These are regressions
caused by the previous fix for the DefaultKeyBinding.dict problem.

*** Successive paste of the same image from other applications via the
clipboard causes duplication in the kill ring.  Reported by Leo.  This
is a regression caused by the previous fix.

*** Fonts in highlighted words with the pop-up dictionary
(Command-Control-D) are sometimes incorrect.  This is a regression
caused by refactoring for the accessibility support.

** Improvements

*** Font design destination can be specified via the `:destination'
font property.  The value 1 means the destination is video text as in
the XLFD Conventions, and screen font metrics are used in that case.
You can see the difference with (make-frame '((font
. "Monaco-9:antialias=off:destination=1"))), for example.

*** Successive paste of different images from other applications via
the clipboard only inserts the first image.  Reported by Leo.

*** Successive SVG image loading in `vrend-clock' by Anders Waldenborg
(http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2010-05/msg00521.html)
fails in a few seconds.

*** The variable `face-ignored-fonts' does not work.
Apply Kenichi Handa's fix for Bug#6287.
This is useful when you want to turn off synthetic bold for some fonts
like (add-to-list 'face-ignored-fonts "\\`-[^-]*-monaco-bold-").
Synthetic bold seems to become lighter if the background is darker
than the foreground and the LCD font smoothing is turned on.

** Improvements

*** "Speak selected text with when the key is pressed", which can be
customized in the Speech pane in the System Preferences, now works.

*** New events: magnify-up/down and rotate-left/right.  They are for
newer trackpads with Mac OS X 10.5.2 and later.  By default,
magnify-up/down, which are issued by pinch out/in, are bound to
scaling text size by text-scale-mode.  With the shift key, they turn
on/off fullscreen status of the frame.

*** Experimental support for accessibility with respect to the custom
view for Emacs frames.  Still there are several glitches.

*** Can't quit while establishing a TCP connection.
Apply a fix for Bug#5723 as well as Helmut Eller's fix for Bug#5173.

** Improvements

*** When a maximized frame is moved with title bar dragging on a
multiple monitor environment, the destination monitor is determined by
the mouse position at the end of dragging.  If such a frame is moved
programmatically, the destination monitor is determined by the maximum
area of the contained part of the frame as before.

*** Menu item "Open Selected File in Emacs" is shown in Services or
context menu of other applications by default on Mac OS X 10.6 when
absolute pathname-like text is selected.

*** Emacs info nodes are accessible via search field in the Help menu

has non-zero internal border width.

** Improvements

*** When the clipboard has both textual and image data, yank inserts
the former and push both into the kill ring so the latter can be
inserted with yank-pop afterwards.

*** Use non-integral x positions for displaying antialiased
proportional fonts.  You can see the difference by putting the box
cursor over Helvetica 12pt `I', whose ideal width is 3.33398 but

*** Mouse highlighting is not updated on popup (de)activations.

*** With `x-select-font', the first click in a list sometimes results
in a wrong selection.

*** Command line options specifying temporary preferences settings

** Fixed bugs

*** Kill/yank in tty frames causes an error.

** Improvements

*** When delete-selection-mode is enabled, then the active region is
hidden while the marked text is being shown (so "Reverse conversion"
in Kotoeri looks better).

*** The current cursor position may be returned for a character
position query for text input even if the marked text is not displayed
or handled at the Lisp level yet (so auxiliary windows in AquaSKK 4
are placed better.)

*** SVG images are supported via WebKit on Mac OS X 10.4 and later.
If you have librsvg installed and you want to use WebKit for rendering
SVG images, then you need to specify --without-rsvg as a configure
option.

*** The Mac font backend driver now supports `get_variation_glyphs'

swipe-up/down/left/right on Mac OS X 10.5.2 and later.

*** The Mac font backend driver now supports `get_variation_glyphs' on
Mac OS X 10.5 and later.  You need some OpenType font containing a

it off by compiling with "-DSELECT_USE_GCD=0".


* emacs-23.1-mac-1.91 [experimental/hackers-only] (2009-08-29)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-08/msg01309.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Doesn't build on Mac OS X 10.6.

*** Multi-page TIFF images are not supported.
I thought they were, but I actually added the code to another working
tree and forgot to merge it in the previous version.

*** "Visit New File" shows a wrong dialog.
Apply Jason Rumney's fix for Bug#3969.

*** Mach port right leaks due to the previous change for the warning
"CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed".

** Improvements

*** File and font dialogs can be closed with C-g on Mac OS X 10.5 and later.


* emacs-23.1-mac-1.90 [experimental/hackers-only] (2009-08-03)
Based on Emacs 23.1.  Rename from "Carbon+AppKit port" to "Mac port".
Drop support for Mac OS X 10.1 and earlier.
Drop GUI implementation with Carbon HIToolbox.
Revamp font handing completely.

* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.5 (2009-08-03)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-08/msg00091.html

** Fixed bugs

*** "open -g" (available on Mac OS X 10.5 and later) does not work.

*** Control-Tab is not recognized on Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier.

** Improvements

*** Resizing truncates the window width/height to multiple of the
nominal character size instead of rounding unless the resizing is
triggered by mouse dragging of the resize handle.

*** Warning "CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed" with
multiple invocations via command-line or "open -n" is suppressed
(except for Mac OS X 10.4).


* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.4 (2009-06-27)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-06/msg00532.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Fringe bitmap display is incorrect if its width is not 8.

*** Crash when calculating Quickdraw font metrics in an invisible frame.

*** Crash when changing internal-border-width of an invisible frame.

*** Assertion failure in mac_set_font.

*** "Hide" in Login Items does not work. 

*** (mac-pasteboard-string-to-string "\342\204\246" 'mac-roman) gives
GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA instead of OHM SIGN (likewise for
mac-utxt-to-string).

*** mac-symbol -> emacs-mule mapping is represented wrong for #x30 - #x37.

** Improvements

*** Conversion between CFNumber and Lisp objects now uses Lisp strings
for integers that don't fit in the Lisp float range.


* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.3 (2009-03-27)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-03/msg00485.html

** Fixed bugs

*** Popup dialog button labels may get corrupted.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-03/msg00261.html

*** Popup dialog does not select the default item with the return key.

*** Tooltip contents are sometimes not shown on 10.4 due to the
previous change for flyspell-small-region slowness.

** Improvements

*** Hourglass (progress indicator) is shown in the title bar.

*** Add f20 and kp-separator to the keycode-to-xkeysym table.


* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.2 (2009-01-24)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2009-01/msg00753.html

** Fixed bugs

*** do-applescript crashes with -nw due to the previous fix for
(do-applescript "choose file") hang.

*** Cursor erasure sometimes fails on Mac OS X 10.5 due to the
previous change for flyspell-small-region slowness.

*** Buffer overrun in creation of Vmac_carbon_version_string.

** Improvements

*** Untag Lisp_Object by subtraction instead of masking.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-01/msg01876.html

*** `select' emulation waits for user signal delivery as well as
window system events and process outputs via sockets.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-10/msg00198.html

*** Hourglass display is enabled.

*** Let the framework decide whether wheel events to non-focus frames
are accepted or not.


* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.1 (2008-11-27)
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-11/msg00993.html

** Fixed bugs

*** 64-bit binary doesn't work with AquaSKK Japanese input method.

*** Tooltip contents are chopped off if the fractional part of the
scaling factor is greater than or equal to 0.5.

*** Crash with tooltip autodisplay that happens when its contents are
not yet ready.

*** (do-applescript "choose file") -> cancel -> hang on 10.5.

*** With asynchronous subprocesses, the "[Complete, but not unique]"
message shown by C-x C-f / TAB TAB will disappear on key release.
(Both Carbon and Carbon+Appkit)

*** Crash with tabbar.el (not specific to the Carbon(+AppKit) port).
http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1337

** Improvements

*** Execution of flyspell-small-region is no longer too slow.

*** The "Visit New File" dialog no longer confirms replacement if an
existing file is specified (only on 10.3 and later).

*** Update display while the resize control (or the slider in the font
panel) is being dragged.

*** Align key bindings shown in a menu.

*** Explicitly link with libncurses.5 if MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET <
1040 to avoid runtime link error when running on the versions without
/usr/lib/libncurses.5.4.dylib.
